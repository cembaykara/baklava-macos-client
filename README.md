# Baklava for macOS

Welcome to Baklava! Baklava is a macOS application that allows you to interact with your self-hosted instance of [Baklava Server](https://github.com/cembaykara/baklava-server). Baklava Server is a feature flag management system that you need to run locally or host on your own server. With Baklava, you can easily manage your feature flags right on your macOS menubar.

This repository contains the source code for a test macOS client application for the Baklava feature flag system. It's designed to be a menubar app that provides a basic interface for interacting with feature flags managed by a Baklava server.
